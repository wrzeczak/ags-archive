# AGS Archive

Tools for archiving AGS, written by Wrzeczak with the support of the AGS community. Most of this stuff can be found at [https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/](https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/index.html), where I am hosting my own archive of AGS' materials.

### bosixx4

**LINK** - [catalog.html](https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/catalog.html)

This folder contains three scripts for parsing and reading the dates from bills passed by Congress; Bo was the one to suggest this to me, so I named the folder on my PC to remind myself which idea was which ("archiver," "catalog," etc. were already taken...). That folder contains its own README which details its function.

### executive

**LINK** - [eos.html](https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/eos.html)

This folder contains two scripts for compiling descriptions, signage dates, and numbers of the Executive Orders passed since 2018. I was writing descriptions of each and then using the scripts to automatically put together a catalog of them. Given that reading and summarizing these is a manual process, I have done up to the Lamport Admin. on the website. Feel free to reach out if you're willing to continue this work.

### unavailable

**LINK** - [unavailable-bills.html](https://wrzeczak.net/stolow/unavailable-bills.html)

This folder contains two scripts I used for collecting all the known deleted bills into a registry. This is mostly completed, so long as no new bills have been deleted. If you find one, please reach out so I can add it to the list!
